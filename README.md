# FrickeFreshScripts

Ever needed to do something quick in Windows or Linux and debating if you should do it by hand or make a script. Well now the script is made so you can't make the wrong choice again.

These are not 100% robust scripts but all will show you options with `--help`

## Windows Scripts

* `file_ext_change.ps1`
	* Will take a set of files and change the file extensions

## Linux Scripts

* `file_ext_change.sh`
	* Will take a set of files and change the file extensions
